   - **Future Directions**: Provide thoughtful suggestions for potential future research inspired by the paper. Highlight areas where further work could address limitations or explore new avenues.
3. **Similarity Check**: Before submitting your critique, ensure that you perform a **similarity check** using Turnitin. The similarity report must accompany your submission to ensure academic integrity.
4. **Formatting and Submission**:
   - Use **Times New Roman** font, size **12**, with **1.5 line spacing**.
   - The critique should be between **1000-1500 words**.
   - Submit both the critique and the Turnitin similarity report by the deadline.

## Guidelines for Writing
