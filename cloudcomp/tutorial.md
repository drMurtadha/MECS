## Answer Scheme 

### 1. Explanation of Deployment Models (20 Marks) 
**Public Cloud**:
- Definition: Services offered over the public internet, accessible to anyone.
- Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP). - Use Case: Startups leveraging public cloud for scalability without heavy upfront costs.
  
**Private Cloud**:
- Definition: Services maintained on a private network, dedicated to a single organization.
- Example: VMware vSphere, Microsoft Azure Stack. - Use Case: Large enterprises with strict data security requirements.

**Hybrid Cloud**:  
- Definition: Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- Example: A company using a private cloud for sensitive data and public cloud for less critical operations.
- Use Case: Businesses needing flexibility and scalability while maintaining control over sensitive data.

**Community Cloud**:  
- Definition: Infrastructure shared by several organizations with common concerns.
- Example: Government agencies sharing a cloud for compliance and security.
- Use Case: Research institutions collaborating on projects requiring shared resources.
  
### 2. Overview of Service Models (20 Marks) 
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**:  
- Definition: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. 
- Example: DigitalOcean, Linode. - Use Case: Companies needing to host applications without investing in physical hardware.

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)**:  
- Definition: Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.
- Example: Heroku, Google App Engine.
- Use Case: Developers building applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

**Software as a Service (SaaS)**:  
- Definition: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
- Example: Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365.
- Use Case: Businesses using CRM software without needing to install or maintain it.
  
### 3. Advantages and Disadvantages (30 Marks) 
**Public Cloud**: 
- Advantages: Cost-effective, scalable, no maintenance. 
- Disadvantages: Security concerns, less control over data.

**Private Cloud**: 
- Advantages: Enhanced security, greater control, compliance.
- Disadvantages: Higher costs, requires management.

**Hybrid Cloud**: 
- Advantages: Flexibility, optimized resource use.
- Disadvantages: Complexity in management, potential security risks.

**Community Cloud**: 
- Advantages: Cost-sharing, collaborative environment. 
- Disadvantages: Limited control, potential for resource contention.

### 4. Structure and Clarity (10 Marks) 
- Ensure the answer is well-organized, with clear headings and subheadings.
- Maintain clarity in writing, avoiding jargon where possible.
    
### 5. References and Citations (10 Marks) 
- Include at least 5 relevant academic references.
- - Use IEEE citation style for all references.
