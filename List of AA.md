Sure, here are 10 alternative assignments (AA) that utilize CloudSIM for the course of Advanced Computer Network and Cloud Computing:

1. **Cloud Resource Allocation**: Implement a resource allocation strategy in CloudSIM and compare its performance with existing strategies. The strategy can be based on parameters like cost, availability, or load balancing.
    
2. **Cloud Service Broker**: Design and implement a cloud service broker in CloudSIM that helps in managing the use of cloud resources from multiple providers based on the userâ€™s requirements.
    
3. **Energy-Efficient Cloud Computing**: Develop an energy-efficient VM scheduling algorithm in CloudSIM. Compare the energy consumption with traditional scheduling algorithms.
    
4. **Fault Tolerance in Cloud**: Simulate a cloud environment with certain failure scenarios. Implement a fault tolerance mechanism and measure its effectiveness.
    
5. **Cloud Workflow Scheduling**: Implement a workflow scheduling algorithm in CloudSIM. The algorithm should consider factors like execution time, cost, and resource availability.
    
6. **Cloud Load Balancing**: Design a load balancing strategy in CloudSIM. Compare its performance with existing load balancing strategies in terms of response time and processing time.
    
7. **Cloud Data Center Design**: Design a cloud data center in CloudSIM with different types of hosts and VMs. Evaluate the performance of the data center under different workloads.
    
8. **Cloud Network Topology**: Create a complex network topology in CloudSIM and analyze the impact of the topology on the performance of cloud services.
    
9. **Cloud Security**: Simulate a cloud environment in CloudSIM and implement a security mechanism (like encryption or intrusion detection system). Evaluate the impact of the security mechanism on the performance of the cloud.
    
10. **Hybrid Cloud Management**: Simulate a hybrid cloud environment in CloudSIM. Implement a management strategy that optimizes the use of resources in both private and public clouds.
    

Each assignment should include a report detailing the problem statement, methodology, implementation, results, and conclusion. The students should also submit the source code of their implementation. These assignments will provide hands-on experience with CloudSIM and a deep understanding of various aspects of cloud computing. Remember to provide adequate time for students to complete these assignments as they are quite involved. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
