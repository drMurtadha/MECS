step-by-step guide to successfully complete Assignment 1: Cloud Resource Allocation:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

- Start by understanding what resource allocation is in the context of cloud computing.
- Research different types of resources in a cloud environment (like CPU, memory, storage, etc.) and how they are allocated to different tasks.

**Step 2: Study Existing Strategies**

- Look into existing resource allocation strategies in cloud computing.
- Understand how they work, their advantages, and their limitations.
- This will give you a good foundation to start designing your own strategy.

**Step 3: Design Your Strategy**

- Based on your understanding from the previous steps, start designing your own resource allocation strategy.
- Consider factors like cost, availability, and load balancing.
- Make sure your strategy is feasible to implement in CloudSIM.

**Step 4: Implement Your Strategy in CloudSIM**

- Start implementing your resource allocation strategy in CloudSIM.
- Make sure to document your code properly for better readability and future reference.

**Step 5: Test Your Strategy**

- After implementing your strategy, itâ€™s time to test it.
- Use different workloads to see how your strategy performs under various conditions.
- Compare its performance with the existing strategies you studied in Step 2.

**Step 6: Write a Report**

- Finally, document your entire process, findings, and conclusions in a report.
- The report should detail your problem statement, methodology, implementation, results, and conclusion.
- This will not only help in grading your assignment but also be a good reference for future projects.

The step-by-step guide to implement your resource allocation strategy in CloudSIM:

**Step 1: Setup CloudSim**

- First, you need to set up CloudSim in your development environment. You can download the CloudSim jar files from the official website and add them to your project.

**Step 2: Create Datacenter**

- In CloudSim, a Datacenter is a Cloud resource that contains multiple hosts. You need to create a Datacenter for your simulation.

```java
Datacenter datacenter = createDatacenter("Datacenter_0");
```

**Step 3: Create Broker**

- A DatacenterBroker is an entity that represents a cloud user. It hides VM management, as well as executing tasks on these VMs.

```java
DatacenterBroker broker = createBroker();
```

**Step 4: Create VMs**

- You need to create one or more VMs. Each VM requires a VM ID, image size (in MB), number of CPUs, amount of RAM (in MB), bandwidth (in Mbps), number of PEs, amount of storage, VMM, and a CloudletScheduler.

```java
int vmid = 0;
int mips = 1000;
long size = 10000; // image size (MB)
int ram = 512; // vm memory (MB)
long bw = 1000;
int pesNumber = 1; // number of cpus
String vmm = "Xen"; // VMM name

Vm vm = new Vm(vmid, brokerId, mips, pesNumber, ram, bw, size, vmm, new CloudletSchedulerTimeShared());

// add the VM to the vmList
vmList.add(vm);
```

**Step 5: Submit VM List to Broker**

- After creating the VMs, you need to submit the list of VMs to the broker.

```java
broker.submitVmList(vmList);
```

**Step 6: Implement Your Resource Allocation Strategy**

- This is where you implement your resource allocation strategy. You can override the `allocateHostForVm` method in your own class that extends the `VmAllocationPolicy` class.

```java
public class MyVmAllocationPolicy extends VmAllocationPolicy {
    @Override
    public boolean allocateHostForVm(Vm vm) {
        // Your resource allocation strategy here
    }
}
```

**Step 7: Start the Simulation**

- Finally, you need to start the simulation and print out the results when the simulation is over.

```java
CloudSim.startSimulation();
CloudSim.stopSimulation();
```

Remember, this is a basic guide. Depending on your resource allocation strategy, you might need to add or modify some steps. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
