**1.7 Case studies and real-world examples**

Some successful IPv6 deployment stories:

1. **Google**: Google faced the challenge of IPv4 address exhaustion due to its expansive global infrastructure. [However, they successfully adopted IPv6 and are now one of the pioneers in IPv6 adoption](https://www.newyorktimesmag.com/blogs_on/ipv6-in-enterprise-networks-challenges-and-benefits)[1](https://www.newyorktimesmag.com/blogs_on/ipv6-in-enterprise-networks-challenges-and-benefits).
    
2. **Comcast**: Comcast, one of the leading Internet Service Providers (ISPs), faced similar challenges with IPv4 address exhaustion. [They found that it was actually cheaper to deploy IPv6 than to continue buying IPv4 addresses](https://www.newyorktimesmag.com/blogs_on/ipv6-in-enterprise-networks-challenges-and-benefits)[2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ipv6-success-stories-advice-community-questions-visions-future-arin-jwiqe).
    
3. **Facebook**: Facebook has driven IPv6 adoption at scale. [Despite the challenges, they have successfully deployed IPv6 across their global infrastructure](https://www.newyorktimesmag.com/blogs_on/ipv6-in-enterprise-networks-challenges-and-benefits)[1](https://www.newyorktimesmag.com/blogs_on/ipv6-in-enterprise-networks-challenges-and-benefits).
    
4. **Akamai**: Akamai, a content delivery network and cloud service provider, optimized their services with IPv6. [They found that supporting IPv6 helped them improve their service delivery](https://www.newyorktimesmag.com/blogs_on/ipv6-in-enterprise-networks-challenges-and-benefits)[3](https://www.arin.net/vault/blog/2016/05/19/ipv6-success-stories-from-companies-that-have-done-it/).
    
5. **Virginia Tech**: Virginia Tech focused on getting dorms and studentsâ€™ personal devices connected to IPv6. [They found that this approach helped them successfully deploy IPv6 across their campus](https://www.newyorktimesmag.com/blogs_on/ipv6-in-enterprise-networks-challenges-and-benefits)[4](https://www.arin.net/blog/2023/05/17/arin-51-ipv6-panel/).
