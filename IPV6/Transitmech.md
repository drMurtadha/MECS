**1.4 Transition mechanism**

Transition techniques from IPv4 to IPv6:

|Transition Technique|Description|
|---|---|
|**Dual-stack**|Dual-stack allows devices to run IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously. [When both devices are dual stacked, they agree on which IP version to use](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[1](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm). [It is often the preferable solution in many scenarios](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[1](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm).|
|**Tunneling**|[Tunneling is used as a medium to communicate the transit network with the different IP versions](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transition-from-ipv4-to-ipv6-address/). [It encapsulates IPv6 packets within IPv4 packets](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[3](https://www.rapidseedbox.com/blog/ipv6-transition-mechanisms). [There are different types of tunneling methods such as 6to4 and Teredo](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transition-from-ipv4-to-ipv6-address/)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling).|
|**6to4**|[6to4 is a technique for forwarding IPv6 packets over an IPv4 network without the need for an explicit tunnel configuration](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipv6-transition-mechanisms/). [It is typically used to connect IPv6 networks separated by an IPv4 backbone](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[5](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ipv6-transition-mechanisms/).|
|**Teredo**|[Teredo is designed to provide IPv6 connectivity to devices outside of an IPv4 NAT router](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling). [It enables IPv6 communication even when the network configuration is not IPv6-configured](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling).|
|**NAT64**|[NAT64 is a mechanism for IPv4-to-IPv6 transition and IPv4-IPv6 coexistence](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[6](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/217208-understanding-nat64-and-its-configuratio.html). [It allows an IPv6-only client to initiate communications to an IPv4-only server](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[6](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/network-address-translation-nat/217208-understanding-nat64-and-its-configuratio.html).|
|**ISATAP**|[ISATAP (Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol) is a transition mechanism used within an organization’s network to facilitate communication between IPv6 and IPv4 hosts](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[7](https://techyoulike.com/what-is-isatap-interface/). [It creates IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels within an organization’s network](https://thwack.solarwinds.com/resources/b/geek-speak/posts/ipv6-and-the-dual-stack-transition-mechanism-dstm)[8](https://www.telecomtrainer.com/isatap-intra-site-automatic-tunnel-addressing-protocol/).|

Please note that these are high-level descriptions and the actual implementation of these techniques can be complex and may require careful planning and configuration.
