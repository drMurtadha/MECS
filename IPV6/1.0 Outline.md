Course learning outcome

1. **CLO 1**: Explain the fundamental concepts of IPv6, including its need due to IPv4 exhaustion and its key differences from IPv4.
2. **CLO 2**: Describe the structure and representation of IPv6 addresses, including different address types (unicast, multicast, anycast).
3. **CLO 3**: Identify and compare the various methods for IPv6 address configuration, such as Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) and DHCPv6, along with privacy considerations.
4. **CLO 4**: Analyze the transition mechanisms from IPv4 to IPv6, including dual-stack, tunneling techniques, and NAT64.
5. **CLO 5**: Discuss IPv6 security features, potential vulnerabilities, and strategies to secure IPv6 networks.
6. **CLO 6**: Evaluate the challenges of IPv6 deployment and coexistence with IPv4, and summarize best practices for a smooth transition to IPv6.
7. **CLO 7**: Critically assess real-world case studies of IPv6 deployment and lessons learned from successful implementations. 

These outcomes focus on comprehension, analysis, and evaluation without requiring hands-on lab work.
